About the Lab

The Valdmanis lab's research focus is to identify pathogenic variants that cause or modify human disease, determine the mechanisms of action of these genes in disease pathogenesis and correct the variants through gene therapy approaches.
Our lab focuses on the following research goals:

1.  Identify novel genetic contributors to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, with a particular emphasis on tandem repeat expansions.
2. Determine dynamics of tandem repeat expansions throughout human evolution using long-read sequencing technology.
3. Develop gene therapy methods for safe and effective gene knockdown using recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) to target genes implicated in neurodegeneration.
4. Perform mechanistic characterization of the role of microRNAs including miR-122 and an imprinted cluster of microRNAs at the DLK1-DIO3 locus  in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
